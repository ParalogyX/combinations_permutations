# combinations_permutations

There are four types:

1. Combination With Repetition.
Order is not important (AB=BA). One item can be used multiple times

2. Combination without repetition.
Order is not important. One item can be selected only ones. Like SportLoto (7 out of 49 etc) or mechanical code locks with buttons (3 out of 10)

3. Permutation with Repetition
Order is important (AB!=BA). One item can be used multiple times. Like electronic code or mechanical code with drums (3 out of 10, like on suitcase).

4. Permutation without Repetition.
Order is important (AB!=BA). One item can be selected only ones.
